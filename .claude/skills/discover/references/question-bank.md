# Question Bank for Discovery Conversations

Extended collection of non-obvious, probing questions organized by domain. Use these to surface hidden complexity and assumptions.

## Data & State Management

### Persistence
- If the app crashes mid-save, what state should we recover to?
- Should this data survive a browser refresh? A logout? A device switch?
- What's the source of truth—client optimistic state or server confirmed state?
- If local and server state conflict, who wins? Can we show both?

### Synchronization
- What's the maximum acceptable staleness for this data?
- If two tabs are open and one makes a change, should the other update?
- During offline mode, what operations should queue vs fail immediately?
- How do we handle "last write wins" conflicts for collaborative data?

### Caching
- What invalidates this cache? Time? Events? User actions?
- If cache is poisoned with bad data, how do we recover?
- Should we prefetch? What's the cost of wrong prefetch predictions?
- What's the memory budget for client-side caching?

## Error Handling & Recovery

### Failure Modes
- What's the blast radius of this component failing?
- Should errors in this feature degrade gracefully or fail loudly?
- If a dependency times out, do we retry, fallback, or error?
- What's the difference between "couldn't load" and "nothing to show"?

### User Recovery
- After an error, what's the minimum action user needs to retry?
- Should we auto-retry in background or require explicit user action?
- If partial data saved, do we show what was saved or hide until complete?
- Can user recover from their mistake without contacting support?

### System Recovery
- If this job fails at step 5 of 10, do we restart from 1 or resume from 5?
- Should failed operations be logged for manual intervention?
- What alerts fire? Who gets paged? At what threshold?
- How do we know the fix worked without causing the same failure?

## User Experience Deep Dives

### Cognitive Load
- What's the user's mental model? Are we matching or fighting it?
- How many new concepts does this introduce? Can we reduce?
- What does the user need to remember vs what should the system remember?

### Feedback Loops
- How long until user knows their action worked?
- If operation takes 30 seconds, what do they see second-by-second?

## Intent Alignment & Should-Want Detection

Questions designed to surface the gap between what users say they want and what they actually need. Use these when you detect should-want framing or when confidence in a dimension plateaus.

### Past Behavior & Failed Attempts
- What are you/your users doing today to solve this problem?
- What specifically frustrates you about the current approach?
- Have you tried to build this before? What happened?
- Have you used an existing tool for this? What was wrong with it?
- What manual workaround exists today? How often is it used?
- When did this problem first bother you enough to want to fix it?

### Daily Use Visualization
- Walk me through a typical day where you'd use this feature.
- What triggers you to open this? What are you doing right before?
- After using this, what do you do next?
- How often would you realistically use this? Daily? Weekly? When something breaks?
- If this feature had a usage counter, what number would disappoint you after a month?

### Forced Tradeoffs
- If you could only keep 2 of these features, which 2 and why?
- Would you rather have this fast and simple, or complete and complex?
- If building this takes twice as long as expected, what do you cut first?
- What's the one thing this absolutely must do on day one?
- If you had to launch with half the features, which half?

### Success Criteria Grounding
- If this ships and works perfectly, what's the first thing you'd notice is different?
- How would you know this is working without looking at analytics?
- What does your user do differently after this exists?
- What complaint or request stops coming in once this ships?
- Six months after launch, what makes you glad you built this?

### The "Why" Chain
- Why this approach specifically? (Then ask "why" to the answer)
- Why now? What changed that makes this urgent?
- Why build vs buy? What's unique about your situation?
- Why this scope? What would a version with half the scope miss?
- Why this audience first? Who else could benefit and why not them?

### Depth Probes
Use when answers feel rehearsed, buzzword-heavy, or disconnected from specific experiences.
- Can you give me a specific example of when this problem happened?
- Who specifically complained about this? What did they say?
- If I asked your users directly, would they describe the problem the same way?
- What's the most embarrassing version of this feature that would still solve the problem?
- Forget best practices for a moment — what do YOU actually want this to do?
