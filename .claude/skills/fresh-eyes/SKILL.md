# Review Chain

*Meta — Dynamic Multi-Agent. Fresh-eyes review chain for post-implementation quality.*

**Core Question:** "What would a senior reviewer with no sunk-cost bias catch?"

## Critical Gates — Read First

1. **Reviewer has NO access to implementation reasoning** — only the output and the requirements. This is intentional: fresh eyes, no bias.
2. **Resolver sees BOTH original + review** — it synthesizes, not just patches
3. **Max 2 loops** — if code isn't clean after 2 review cycles, flag to the user. There may be a deeper design problem that review can't fix.
4. **Auto-trigger for critical code** — security, auth, crypto, data mutations, money, PII. Don't wait to be asked.

## Inputs Required
- Code, artifact, or output to verify
- The original requirements or prompt that produced it
- Relevant context (surrounding files, API contracts, tests)

## Output
- `.agents/meta/fresh-eyes-report.md` — verdict, issues found/fixed/declined, changes made

## Chain Position
- **After:** Any domain skill — system-architecture, task-breakdown, code-cleanup, or raw implementation
- **Together with discover:** discover before build, fresh-eyes after build

---

## Pre-Dispatch

Run the Pre-Dispatch protocol (`meta-skills/references/pre-dispatch-protocol.md`) before spawning reviewer/resolver agents.

**Needed dimensions:** diff/branch reference (what to review), risk class (security / performance / correctness / all), prior reviewer feedback if any, requirements or spec the work was supposed to implement.

**Read order:**
1. Conversation context — usually fresh-eyes is invoked right after the work it's reviewing, so the spec lives in the same session.
2. Pipeline: `.agents/spec.md`, `.agents/tasks.md`, `architecture/system-architecture.md` if referenced.
3. Git: `git diff <base>...HEAD` or named branch.

**Warm Start** (invoked at end of build session, spec known): summarize what's being reviewed and dispatch.

```
Reviewing [N files / diff vs main] against [spec.md / tasks.md / inline requirements].
Risk class: [auto-detected: security touched, money/PII flag, etc.] — adjust?
```

**Cold Start** (no upstream session, user invoking standalone):

```
fresh-eyes runs an independent post-implementation review. Before I dispatch:

1. **What to review** — diff, branch name, file paths, or paste of the artifact.
2. **Risk class** — security / performance / correctness / consistency / all.
   Auto-trigger applies for security, auth, crypto, money, PII regardless.
3. **Original intent** — paste the spec, requirements, or one-paragraph
   description of what this code is supposed to do. Without this, the review
   only catches obvious bugs, not goal-fit problems.

Answer 1-3 in one response. I'll dispatch reviewer + resolver.
```

**Write-back:** none. Reviews are ephemeral — overwrite the previous report each run, no experience-file persistence.

---

## Orchestration Pattern: Dynamic Agent Spawning

This skill uses runtime-defined agents (reviewer, resolver), NOT the static agent roster pattern. Agent prompts are constructed per-use based on the artifact being reviewed. There is no `agents/` directory.

---

## Execution

### 1. Identify what to verify

Determine what output needs verification:
- **Code just written** — the most common case. You just implemented something, now verify it.
- **Architecture/design decision** — verify a plan before implementing.
- **User-provided code** — user asks you to review their code with this pattern.
- **Any prior output** — user says "double-check that" or "verify this".

Gather the full artifact to review:
- The code/output itself
- The original requirements or prompt that produced it
- Any relevant context (surrounding files, API contracts, tests)

### 2. Spawn the Reviewer

Spawn a single reviewer agent with fresh context. The reviewer has NO access to the implementation reasoning — only the output and the requirements.

**Agent config:**
- `model: "sonnet"` (default — use opus if the code is complex or security-critical)

**Learned rules:** Before constructing the reviewer prompt, read `.agents/meta/learned-rules.md`. If any rules are relevant to the code being reviewed, append them to the CONTEXT section of the reviewer prompt.

**Reviewer prompt:**

```
You are a senior code reviewer with fresh eyes. You did NOT write this code.
Your job is to find problems.

ORIGINAL REQUIREMENTS:
{what the code was supposed to do}

CODE/OUTPUT TO REVIEW:
{the full artifact}

CONTEXT:
{surrounding code, API contracts, types, or other relevant files}

Review for:
1. **Correctness** — Does it actually do what the requirements ask? Are there logic errors?
2. **Edge cases** — What inputs or states would break this? Empty arrays, null values,
   concurrent access, network failures?
3. **Simplification** — Is anything over-engineered? Can any code be removed or simplified
   without losing functionality?
4. **Security** — SQL injection, XSS, command injection, auth bypasses, secrets in code?
5. **Consistency** — Does it match the patterns and conventions of the surrounding codebase?
6. **Input Quality** — Was this built on solid ground? Check what context the implementation
   had access to. Rate each:
   - Product/domain context: Rich (from research/spec) | Thin (user-provided, minimal) | Missing (improvised)
   - Requirements clarity: Precise (specific acceptance criteria) | Vague (general direction only) | Absent
   - Upstream artifacts: Fresh (< 30 days) | Stale (> 30 days) | None
   This is not about the code quality — it is about whether the RIGHT thing was built.
   A perfectly crafted solution to the wrong problem is still wrong.

Respond in this exact format:

VERDICT: PASS | ISSUES_FOUND | CRITICAL

ISSUES (if any):
For each issue:
- SEVERITY: critical | major | minor | nit
- CONFIDENCE: [1-10] (how certain you are this is a real problem — 10 = proven, 7 = likely, 4 = possible, 1 = speculative)
- LOCATION: {file:line or section}
- PROBLEM: {what's wrong}
- FIX: {concrete fix — show the corrected code, not just "fix this"}

SIMPLIFICATIONS (if any):
- {what can be removed or simplified, with the simpler version}

SUMMARY: {one paragraph — overall assessment}

**Confidence rules:**
- Suppress findings below 5/10 — don't include them at all.
- Caveat findings 5-7/10 — include them but mark as "UNCERTAIN — may be a false positive."
- Full-weight findings 8+/10 — these are real issues.
- If you can cite a specific line, test, or proof, confidence should be 8+.
- If you're pattern-matching without verification, confidence should be 5-7.

**Verification rules (signal vs noise):**
Before reporting any issue, verify it is SIGNAL not NOISE:
- CHECK if the problem is already handled elsewhere in the code (a different file,
  a wrapper, a middleware, a test). If handled, it is noise — do not report it.
- CHECK if the fix already exists (the "improvement" you would suggest is already
  implemented under a different name or in a different location). If it exists, it is noise.
- ASK "has this actually caused a problem, or is it theoretical?" If purely theoretical
  with no plausible trigger path, downgrade to nit or suppress.
- ASK "will this fix actually change runtime behavior?" If the fix is cosmetic or
  the code path is equivalent, it is noise.
Issues that survive verification are signal. Issues that fail any check are noise —
suppress them entirely. Do not pad the report with noise to appear thorough.

Be ruthless. Better to flag a false positive than miss a real bug.
But don't invent problems that don't exist — if the code is clean, say PASS.

Write your response directly — do not write to any files.
```

### 3. Evaluate the review

Read the reviewer's output. Three paths:

**Path A: PASS (no issues)**
The reviewer found nothing wrong. You're done. Report to the user:
- "Verified by independent reviewer — no issues found."
- Include the reviewer's summary as confirmation.

**Path B: ISSUES_FOUND (non-critical)**
The reviewer found real issues but nothing catastrophic. Before proceeding to the Resolve step, classify each finding:
- **AUTO_FIX**: confidence 9+ AND severity minor/nit → resolver applies without asking
- **ASK**: everything else → resolver presents these to the user for judgment after fixing

**Path C: CRITICAL**
The reviewer found a critical bug (security vulnerability, data loss, completely wrong logic). Flag immediately to the user before resolving — they may want to change approach entirely.

### 4. Spawn the Resolver (if issues found)

The resolver sees BOTH the original implementation AND the review. Its job is to produce a corrected version.

**Agent config:**
- `model: "sonnet"` (match the reviewer's model)

**Resolver prompt:**

```
You are a senior engineer resolving code review feedback. You have two inputs:

1. ORIGINAL CODE:
{the original implementation}

2. REVIEW FEEDBACK:
{the reviewer's full response}

Your job:
- Fix every issue marked "critical" or "major"
- Fix "minor" issues unless the fix would add complexity disproportionate to the benefit
- Apply simplifications where the reviewer's suggestion is genuinely simpler
- Ignore "nit" level feedback unless trivial to address
- Issues marked AUTO_FIX (confidence 9+, severity minor/nit) should be fixed without discussion
- Issues marked ASK should be fixed but flagged clearly so the orchestrator can present them to the user
- Do NOT introduce new features or refactor beyond what the review requested

For each issue, either:
- FIXED: {show the fix}
- DECLINED: {explain why the reviewer's suggestion doesn't apply or would make things worse}

Then output the COMPLETE corrected code/output — not a diff, the full thing.
The orchestrator will use this to replace the original.

Write your response directly — do not write to any files.
```

### 5. Apply the resolution

Read the resolver's output. You (the orchestrator) apply the corrected code to disk.

Before applying, sanity-check:
- Did the resolver address all critical/major issues?
- Did the resolver break anything the original got right?
- Are any "DECLINED" decisions reasonable?

**Self-regulation gate:** Track cumulative changes. If any of these trigger, STOP and flag to the user instead of applying:
- The resolver modified >30% of the original artifact — "This artifact may need a redesign rather than incremental fixes."
- The resolver addressed >10 findings in a single pass — too many changes at once increases regression risk.
- The resolver's output introduces new issues that the reviewer didn't find in the original (regression) — "The resolver is making things worse. Stopping."

If the resolver's output looks good and passes the self-regulation gate, apply it.

### 6. Optional: Loop (for critical or complex code)

For high-stakes code (auth, payments, data migrations), run a second verification loop on the resolver's output. This catches issues the resolver might have introduced.

**Max loops: 2.** If the code isn't clean after 2 review cycles, stop and flag to the user.

```
Round 1: Implement → Review → Resolve
Round 2: Resolve output → Review → Resolve (if needed)
Done.
```

### 7. Write the report

Write to `.agents/meta/fresh-eyes-report.md`:

```markdown
---
skill: fresh-eyes
version: 1
date: {YYYY-MM-DD}
status: done | done_with_concerns | blocked | needs_context
---

# Review Chain Report

**Artifact**: {what was reviewed}
**Date**: {date}
**Rounds**: {how many review cycles}

## Verdict: {PASS | FIXED | CRITICAL}

## Issues Found
| # | Severity | Confidence | Location | Problem | Status |
|---|----------|------------|----------|---------|--------|
| 1 | major | 9/10 | file.ts:42 | Off-by-one in loop | Fixed |
| 2 | minor | 8/10 | file.ts:15 | Unused import | Fixed |
| 3 | nit | 6/10 | file.ts:8 | Naming convention | Declined (uncertain) |

## Input Quality Assessment
| Input | Rating | Evidence |
|-------|--------|----------|
| Product/domain context | {Rich/Thin/Missing} | {what was available} |
| Requirements clarity | {Precise/Vague/Absent} | {source} |
| Upstream artifacts | {Fresh/Stale/None} | {what existed} |

## Simplifications Applied
{What was simplified and why}

## Changes Made
{Summary of what changed between original and final version}

## Reviewer's Summary
{The reviewer's overall assessment}

## Resolver's Notes
{Any "DECLINED" decisions and reasoning}
```

## Next Step

If PASS: hand off to commit/PR creation (e.g., `gh pr create`). If ISSUES_FOUND: resolve and re-run. If more than 2 cycles: escalate to user.

### 8. Deliver results

Present to the user:
- **Verdict** — PASS (clean) or FIXED (issues found and resolved) or CRITICAL (flagged)
- **Issue count** — X issues found, Y fixed, Z declined
- **Key fix** — the most important thing that was caught
- File path to report

## When to Trigger Automatically

Use fresh-eyes proactively (without the user asking) when:
- Writing security-sensitive code (auth, crypto, access control)
- Writing data-mutation code (migrations, bulk updates, deletes)
- The implementation was complex or you felt uncertain
- The code handles money or PII

Do NOT auto-trigger for:
- Trivial changes (typos, config tweaks, adding a log line)
- Code the user explicitly said "just do it quick"
- Read-only operations

## Specialist Dispatch Mode (--thorough)

When invoked with `--thorough`, or when the code touches security/auth/payments/data-mutations, replace the single generalist reviewer with 3 specialist reviewers running in parallel:

**Specialist roles:**

| Specialist | Focus | What it catches that generalists miss |
|------------|-------|--------------------------------------|
| **Security reviewer** | Auth bypasses, injection, secrets, access control, input validation | Deep knowledge of attack patterns — doesn't just check "is there auth?" but "can the auth be bypassed?" |
| **Performance reviewer** | N+1 queries, unbounded loops, missing pagination, memory leaks, caching | Traces data flow through the call stack looking for scale problems |
| **Correctness reviewer** | Logic errors, edge cases, race conditions, error handling, type safety | Reads the code as a state machine — "what happens if X is null AND Y fails?" |

**How it works:**
1. Spawn all 3 specialists in parallel with the same code and requirements. Each specialist uses the same prompt structure as the generalist reviewer (Section 2), but replace the "Review for:" instructions with the specialist's focus area. For example, the security reviewer gets: "Review ONLY for: auth bypasses, injection, secrets exposure, access control, input validation. Ignore style, naming, and performance."
2. Each returns findings in the standard format (SEVERITY + CONFIDENCE + LOCATION + PROBLEM + FIX)
3. Merge all findings, deduplicate (same location + same problem = one finding, keep higher confidence)
4. Proceed to resolver with the merged findings

**When to auto-escalate to specialist mode** (without user asking):
- Code modifies auth, sessions, or access control
- Code handles payments or financial data
- Code performs database migrations or bulk data mutations
- Code processes PII or sensitive user data
- Total diff exceeds 500 lines (sum of all files changed, not per-file)

**Cost:** 3x single reviewer cost. Still cheap relative to catching a production bug.

## Scope Drift Detection

When `.agents/tasks.md` or `.agents/spec.md` exists, the reviewer adds a scope check:

After reviewing code quality, compare the implementation against the stated requirements:
- Read `.agents/tasks.md` — are all tasks addressed? Are there changes that don't map to any task?
- Read `.agents/spec.md` — does the implementation match the spec? Are there requirements that were missed or scope additions that weren't planned?

Report scope drift findings separately:

```
SCOPE DRIFT:
- MISSING: [requirement from spec/tasks not found in the code]
- UNPLANNED: [code change that doesn't map to any requirement — may be scope creep]
```

Scope drift findings are informational (not blocking) — the user decides if they're intentional.

## Configuration

| Parameter | Default | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| model | sonnet | Model for reviewer and resolver |
| max_loops | 1 | Review cycles (set to 2 for critical code) |
| severity_threshold | minor | Minimum severity to fix (minor, major, critical) |
| auto_apply | true | Apply fixes automatically or show diff first |
| thorough | false | Use specialist dispatch (3 parallel reviewers) instead of generalist |

User can override: "review this with opus", "do 2 rounds of verification", or "review this thoroughly".

## Cost Considerations

- 1 round (reviewer + resolver) with sonnet: ~$0.10-0.20
- 1 round with opus: ~$0.50-1.00
- 2 rounds doubles the cost
- Very cheap relative to the quality improvement — default to running 1 round for non-trivial code

## Edge Cases

- **Reviewer finds no issues**: PASS. Don't force a resolve step.
- **Reviewer hallucinates issues**: The resolver catches this — if the "fix" doesn't make sense, the resolver DECLINES it. If both agents agree on a non-issue, you catch it in your sanity check.
- **Resolver introduces new bugs**: This is why round 2 exists for critical code.
- **Reviewer and resolver disagree**: You (the orchestrator) break the tie.
- **Code is too large**: Split into logical chunks and review each separately. Don't send 2000 lines in one prompt.
- **Existing report**: Overwrite `.agents/meta/fresh-eyes-report.md` — these are ephemeral process artifacts, not archives.
- **Reviewer or resolver agent fails**: If the reviewer crashes or returns garbage, retry once with the same prompt. If it fails again, fall back to your own review (single-agent mode). Note the failure in the report.
- **Architecture or design review** (not code): Adjust the reviewer prompt — replace "code" references with "design" or "architecture". The 5 review categories still apply (Correctness, Edge cases, Simplification, Security, Consistency).

## Output Files

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `.agents/meta/fresh-eyes-report.md` | Verification report with issues and resolutions |

Previous reports are overwritten — these are ephemeral quality tools, not archives.

---

## Completion Status

Every run ends with explicit status:
- **DONE** — all reviewer findings resolved by resolver, or explicitly marked acceptable; PASS gate met
- **DONE_WITH_CONCERNS** — non-blocking issues flagged for follow-up; report names what was deferred and why
- **BLOCKED** — critical issue surfaced (security, data-loss, broken contract) requiring user judgment before proceeding
- **NEEDS_CONTEXT** — review requirements unclear; missing the spec, intent, or acceptance criteria the implementation should be checked against
